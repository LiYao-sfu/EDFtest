Title: Goodness of Fit Based on Empirical Distribution Function
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Description: This repository contains software for the calculation of goodness-of-fit test statistics 
    and their P-values. The three statistics computed are the Empirical Distribution function statistics 
    called CramÃ©r-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and Watson's statistic. The statistics and their P-values 
    can be used to assess an assumed distribution.The following distirbutions are available: Normal, Gamma, 
    Logistic, Laplace, Weibull and Exponential.
