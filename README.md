# EDFtest
This package contains software for the calculation of goodness-of-fit
test statistics and their P-values.  The three statistics computed are the
Empirical Distribution function statistics called Cram√©r-von Mises, Anderson-Darling,
and Watson statistic.  

The statistics and their P-values can be used to assess an assumed distribution. In the simplest situation
you have an i.i.d. sample from some distribution F and want to test the hypothesis that the sample is drawn from
a distribution F which belongs to a specified parametric family of distributions against the alternative that 
F is not equal to any member of that parametric family. The following families are available:
Uniform(min, max),
Normal(location, scale),
Gamma(shape, scale),
Logistic(location, scale),
Laplace(location, scale),
Weibull(shape, scale), and
Exponential(scale).

This package also contains funtion `gof.sandwich` which performs Goodness-of-Fit tests for general distributions 
using Sandwich estimation of covariance function. This function tests the hypothesis that data y come from 
distribution `Fdist` with unknown parameter values theta. Estimates of theta must be provided.
It uses a large sample approximation to the limit distribution based on the use of the score function components
to estimate the Fisher information and the limiting covariance function of the empirical process.

For the next release, `EDFtest` package will include regression models in which a response Y is related to predictors X. 
The model specifies the conditional distribution of Y given X.  It will contains codes
for situations where the conditional distribution is one of the list given above.  The 
following models are handled:

## Installation
There are several ways you can install GitHub packages into R. For example,
You can install our package by using `devtools`. You need to install `devtools` package first if you have not.


Step 1: Install the `devtools` package
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Step 2: Install our `EDFtest` package and load it
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("LiYao-sfu/EDFtest")
library("EDFtest")
```

## Troubleshooting
This package is still under development. EDF test for regression models and discrete discrete distributions 
will be available for the next release.

If you encounter a clear bug, You could create an issue on github. For other questions, please contact Li Yao by <yaoliy@sfu.ca>.
